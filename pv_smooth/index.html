                <h1 id="smoothing-of-pv-power-intermittency">Smoothing of PV power intermittency</h1>
<p>Energy balancing between the grid and the battery may eliminate the PV intermittency almost loss-free. The objective of a loss-free smoothing is to meet the maximum allowed ramping limits of PV power (relevant technical standard is expected here) while accumulating the minimum possible energy by the filter. If the smooth PV power is generated by a low-pass filter (LPF) excited by the electrical output of PV panels, such a power filter induces high accumulation costs due to a time lag (group delay) of its response. The time lag could be eliminated, if LPF was excited by the future PV power signal. Unfortunately, the short-time PV prediction (nowcasting) is not exact and its error dramatically increases the accumulated energy by the predictive low-pass filter (PLPF, see Figure 1). Recently, various 
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032119304459">predictive-filtering techniques</a>
 (e.g. 
<a href="https://www.planetanalog.com/five-things-to-know-about-prediction-and-negative-delay-filters/">zero group-delay filter</a> 
, moving average, moving median, 
<a href="https://www.kalmanfilter.net/default.aspx">Kalman filter</a>
 etc.) have been developed to avoid the accumulation of PV energy due to the LPF time lag and nowcasting error. Nevertheless, the accumulation of PV power and its cost induced by those non-standard filters still exceed the production cost of e.g. nuclear electricity.<br />
<strong>We focus our analysis on the application of a

</figure>
<p>In the schematic diagram on Figure 1, PV power plant (PVPP) is connected to the grid and its intermittent PV power p(t) is accumulated or compensated (i.e. smoothed) by the accumulator (BESS). The smoothing power is actuated by a two-way inverter AC/DC and it is determined by the ouput signal p(t)-s(t+Δt) of a differencer. Positive sign of the smoothing power is oriented from the grid to BESS. Hence total power superimposed to the grid by PVPP and BESS is determined by the filter’s output signal s(t+Δt).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In case of <strong>LPF</strong> smoothing, the measured signal p(t) would bypass the predictor, directly exciting LPF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In theory, ideal predictive smoothing <strong>IPLPF</strong> would excite LPF by the exact future PV power signal p(t+Δt) where the time advance Δt is absolutely equal to the LPF's group delay at frequencies f&lt;&lt;fc, and fc is the cut-off frequency of LPF. The smooth power signal s(t+Δt) would be the response of LPF to the input signal p(t+Δt).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>According to the schematic diagram, <strong>PLPF</strong> smoothing method excites LPF by a predicted PV power signal pf(t+Δt). Its predictor is trained by a sky-imagery signal and by the measured PV power p(t).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eventually, a smart smoothing method <strong>SPLPF</strong> has been designed, exciting the filter by the PV predictor, though using another scheme.</p>

<h2 id="accumulation-of-energy-by-smoothing">Accumulation of energy by smoothing</h2>
<p>For the simplification of our analysis, PVPP and BESS are single-phase-connected to the grid, and energy losses by the AC/DC conversion and by the accumulation are neglected.<br />
Time course of the accumulated energy by BESS:</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">SOC(t)=\int_{0}^t (p(\tau)-s(\tau+\Delta t))d\tau\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)</script>
</p>
<p>defines the change of its state-of-charge SOC [Wh] since time=0 until time=t, while SOC may acquire both positive and negative values. The time advance Δt reduces absolute values of the integrated function. Always-positive SOC values can be technically achieved if BESS consists of two separate batteries. The above-defined time advance Δt ensures that following technical criteria are satisfied:<br />
Mean value of SOC is near to zero: <script type="math/tex; mode=display">{1 \over T} \int_{0}^T SOC (t) dt ≈ 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (2)</script>
</p>
<p>Mean quadratic deviation of SOC is near to minimum: <script type="math/tex; mode=display">{1 \over T} \int_{0}^T SOC^2 (t) dt ≈ min\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (3)</script>
</p>
<p>Hence near-to-minimum required accumulaton capacity per cycle: <script type="math/tex; mode=display">\Delta SOC = max(SOC) – min(SOC) ≈ min\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (4)</script>
</p>
<p>and near-to-minimum throughput of accumulated energy per cycle: <script type="math/tex; mode=display">{1 \over 2} \int_{0}^T|p(\tau)-s(\tau+\Delta t)|d \tau ≈ min\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (5)</script>
</p>
<p>The rate of accumulation is expressed by (4) and (5) which are minimized by Δt during a working cycle T = 24 hours (in case of PV energy). The rate of accumulation is also expressed by the power demand during a solar gap. This results from the installed power of PVPP.</p>
<p>Let us assume that PV power is proportional to the global solar irradiance GI [W/m2]. In our experiment, the solar irradiance is intercepted by a planar panel 20cm x 16cm on the earth’s surface at latitude=48.2°N, longitude=17.1°E, and the plane of incidence is elevated by 47°, south-oriented. Based on the proportionality between the PV power p(t) and the global irradiance GI(t), we substitute the signals p(τ), s(τ+Δt) in (1) by the measured signal GI(τ) and by its “predicted-and-smoothed” counterpart. After substituting, the expression (1) computes the time course of specific accumulated energy GX(t) [Wh/m2] by the filter.</p>
<h2 id="ideal-smoothing-iplpf">Ideal smoothing (IPLPF)</h2>
<p>We simulate the operation of ideal predictive PV smoothing (IPLPF) by means of LPF excited by the exact future signal GI(t+Δt) where GI(t) is measured and the time advance Δt (given by the LPF group delay) eliminates the filter’s time lag. In theory, such a "ex post" simulated smoothing would minimize the accumulation of energy by the filter. This analysis aims to reveal the theoretical potential and affordability of PV smoothing. The numeric experiment is based on the measured solar irradiance over a period of 1 year, assuming contemporary prices of Lithium-Ion accumulators and EDLC supercapacitors.<br />
The measured GI time series eventually allows to calculate the specific accumulator’s capacity [Wh/m2], its specific power [W/m2], specific energy throughput [Wh/m2/day], [Wh/m2/year] requested by the IPLPF smoothing. Based on the accumulators’ specifications and prices as of 2021, the corresponding accumulation costs have been calculated. A numerical simulation proved that the IPLPF is definitely worthwhile with the German power purchase tariff and PV feed-in tariff in 2021. The ideal smoothing costs are substantially lower than the difference between purchase tariff and PV feed-in tariff (assuming that the smooth PV infeed partially compensates for the distribution costs). 
The simulation suggests an affordable smoothing model for a hybrid small-scale PV plant, and suggests the accumulation technology for large-scale PV plants.  </p>

<p>The left graph shows the measured and low-passed (legend “lp”) GI signals on a day with a high solar exposure and strong intermittency. The graph on the right shows the specific accumulated energy GX [Wh/m2] by IPLPF vs. LPF on the same day. The time course of GX is proportional to the battery's state of charge SOC [Wh]. Exactly-predicted input signal shifts the IPLPF output to the left (legend “aavg0”), minimizing the standard deviation of SOC, thus in practise minimizing the difference delta(SOC) = max(SOC) – min(SOC) which represents the necessary accumulation capacity. The throughput of accumulated energy (other than delta SOC) is also minimized by IPLPF.</p>
<h3 id="costs-of-iplpf-smoothing">Costs of IPLPF smoothing</h3>
<p>The smoothing costs result from the energy accumulation. The accumulation costs are given by the accumulation rate and technology (e.g. Lithium battery, supercapacitor etc.). In theory, the accumulation rate is given by the intermittency of solar irradiance vs. desired time course of the output PV power. The accumulation rate is expressed by following parameters:</p>
<ol>
<li>maximum power [W] from/to BESS, balancing the intermittent PV power</li>
<li>mandated BESS capacity, i.e. maximum delta SOC [Wh] reserved for smoothing</li>
<li>total accumulated energy throughput [Wh] by smoothing</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, the parameters 2. and 3. are larger the more imperfectly the balancing power between the grid and the battery is controlled. In the illustrated example, IPLPF uses 24% delta SOC relative to LPF, and IPLPF accumulates about 50% of the energy throughput if compared to LPF. Both the accumulated SOC and energy throughput reach their theoretical minimum by means of IPLPF smoothing.<br />
The higher LPF order or its lower cut-off frequency, the smoother output, but "earlier" input signal needed to eliminate the filter's time lag. (In case of PLPF smoothing: The greater Δt, the greater prediction error and the greater rate of accumulation.)<br />
The IPLPF simulation has proved that a hybrid PV system i.e. a small-scale on-grid PV plant having its own BESS with capacity = 2 hours x Ppvmax, need &lt;10% of the BESS capacity to be reserved for smoothing (7% as of 2022-03-04), while its rest BESS capacity is left for the energy storage. The hybrid PV plant feeds its “overflow” power into the grid, as long as the household’s consumption is satisfied and the battery has been charged. <strong><em>With such a storage capacity and battery power, the IPLPF costs are reasonably lower than the expected added value to the smooth PV power infeed is.</em></strong>  </p>
<p>IPLPF costs measured from 04/2021 to 03/2022. The plane of incidence and applied LPF are the same as on the graphs GI(t) and GX(t):<br />

<p>CapEx of "Hybrid with BESS” system include 90% of the accu-capacity reserved for storage, 10% for smoothing.<br />
Infeed to grid by "Hybrid with BESS” on-grid system: 1/3 of the generated PV energy is assumed as infeed to the grid (overflow).<br />
Li-Ion &amp; supercapacitor (SC): <a href="https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-209-how-does-a-supercapacitor-work">life cycle parameters and prices</a> are as of 2021.<br />
Hybrid supercapacitor (HSC): estimated price is based on the relation btw. Li-Ion and SC prices.</p>
<p>The costs are specific per 1 kW of installed PV power. Installed PV power = DC output power of PV plant (before DC/AC conversion) assuming its solar incidence 1kW/m2 (1 Sun).<br />
CapEx = initial investment to PV smoothing. OpEx = regular (e.g. yearly) costs necessary for its uninterrupted function. The greater from (CapEx, interval * OpEx) defines the cost of PV smoothing for a given service interval. However, when the smoothing uses &gt;1 accumulation technologies concurrently, the service interval has to be fixed before calculating OpEx. (Reason: Given the service interval, two technologies with different wear-outs can be optimally mixed.) Hybrid systems and sole PV plants use different cost models, because the sole PV plant uses a mixed accumulation technology for smoothing. Energy losses due to the AC/DC conversion and accumulation were neglected.</p>
<h3 id="applications-of-iplpf">Applications of IPLPF</h3>
<h4 id="small-scale-hybrid-pv-system">Small-scale hybrid PV system</h4>
<p>A household with installed PV power &lt;10kW is connected to the low-voltage grid, having a BESS with energy capacity ≈ 2h x installed power. After charging the BESS to a threshold SOC (e.g. 88%), the BESS provides enough power to smooth the PV infeed (overflowing PV power) to the grid for affordable costs, provided that the remaining free BESS capacity is left for smoothing and additional technical measures avoid the microcycling of BESS. The power intermittency of small scale PV plants has no impact on the grid, unless their concentration in the grid is high. <strong><em>IPLPF technology offers an affordable smoothing of PV power in the grid areas with high concentration of small-scale hybrid PV systems.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="suitable-accumulators-for-iplpf">Suitable accumulators for IPLPF</h4>
<p>The measured signal GI(t) determines the specific accumulation parameters GXmax [Wh/m2] and GImax [W/m2] required for smoothing by the IPLPF method. Although IPLPF shrinks the necessary delta(SOC) and total throughput to their theoretical minimum, by contrast it increases the relative smoothing power up to 10C, since no algorithm can supply the missing PV power while the direct Sun beams are obscured by clouds. Lithium accumulators are cheap, efficient and fast, but not enough powerful for a sole IPLPF smoothing. It is not recommended to charge/draw a Li-Ion battery with relative power (Pmax x 1h)/SOCmax &gt;&gt; 1, otherwise the battery’s life cycle would be curtailed. Such a high relative power is provided by EDLC supercapacitors (SC), but on contrary to Lithium bateries, these do not provide enough cheap capacity to satisfy the IPLPF smoothing. Currently there is a lack of electric accumulation technology harmonizing with the sole IPLPF smoothing of PV power.<br />
Actually, the IPLPF demands are well satisfied by a 
<a href="https://energystorage.org/why-energy-storage/technologies/flywheel-energy-storage-systems-fess/">flywheel (FESS)</a>
: 1) Its max(SOC) poses no limit to max(P), 2) IPLPF accumulates energy only when the solar intermittency persists (else no accumulator is needed), and the flywheel only wears out when it is rotating (with mechanical bearings). Because of unknown prices and life cycle parameters, we calculated neither CapExp, nor OpExp of the flywheel in a role of IPLPF accumulator. However, <strong><em>the synergy between demands and features identifies the flywheel as a suitable accumulator for IPLPF smoothing.</em></strong></p>
<h4 id="large-scale-pv-plant">Large-scale PV plant</h4>
<p>Water pumps provide efficient storage for large scale PV plants (cheaper and cleaner than a corresponding BESS), but no power smoothing because the water pumps are too sluggish for such a task. Large-scale PV intermittency can be smoothed by an accumulator with a relatively low capacity =delta(SOC) and large relative power up to 10C. 
We have optimized the IPLPF smoothing for a large-scale PV plant by mixing 2 technologies: SC and HSC concurrently operating during 15 years of service. The future HSC technology is already being developed: 
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032118307299">hybrid supercapacitor</a>
, combining advantages of EDLC &amp; RedOx technologies.</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-iplpf">Summary of IPLPF</h3>
<p>One year of continous measurement GI(t) has confirmed that ideal PV smoothing can be affordable with the current Lithium-Ion technology - if properly implemented in a hybrid PV plant (incl. measures against micro-cycling of battery). Although the HSC technology is yet unavailable, the intensive seek for energy makes it very likely to be soon mature for large-scale installations. Flywheel can be an affordable energy storage in the IPLPF smoothing of PV power. <strong><em>Low accumulation rate by the IPLPF smoothing should motivate the further development of technologies among which accurate nowcasting of PV power and smart filtering of PV power are crucial.</em></strong></p>
<h2 id="real-smoothing-of-pv-power">Real smoothing of PV power</h2>
<p>The measured global irradiance signal GI(t) allows not only the simulation of ideal predictive low-pass smoothing (IPLPF), but also allows for the predictive smoothing of PV power (PLPF), exciting a low-pass filter (LPF) by a real-predicted signal GIf(t+Δt). The values GIf are biased by a prediction error. As we will show, this error induces a significant accumulation of energy by PLPF, if compared with IPLPF. We simulated the prediction error to the measured GI values in order to statistically represent the real predicted signal GIf(t+Δt). Based on the measured signal GI(t), the "ex-post" simulation of PLPF allowed us to empirically analyze its smoothing performance and energy accumulation.<br />
In addition to PLPF, we have developed a “smart predictive low-pass smoothing” method (patent pending SPLPF), minimizing the accumulated energy with respect to the real-predicted values GIf exciting the LPF. Finally, we analyzed the performance of four different PV smoothing methods:</p>
<ol>
<li>LPF: Input of LPF is excited by the measured signal GI(t)</li>
<li>IPLPF: Input of LPF is excited by the measured, optimally left-shifted signal GI(t+Δt)</li>
<li>PLPF: Input of LPF is excited by the simulated-predicted signal GIf(t+Δt)</li>
<li>SPLPF: Power filter is excited by the simulated-predicted signal GIf.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="simulation-of-predicted-pv-power">Simulation of predicted PV power</h3>
<p>We simulated the predicted signal GIf(t+Δt) from the measured, left-shifted GI signal by interval Δt, by smoothing its future time course and by superimposing a random error to its future values with respect to the fundamental properties of PV predictors:</p>
<ul>
<li>as the advance Δt increases, the (unwanted) smoothing of the predicted signal GIf strengthens,</li>
<li>as the advance Δt increases, the impact of  random error on GIf increases (statistically cumulates).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both errors are applied at the "future" time t+Δt, whereas the LPF group delay hence Δt depend on the requested rate of PV power smoothing, and on the LPF order. In the simulation, we control the prediction error by 2 quantitative (OLAP) dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interval of prediction, after passing of which the smoothing impact on the predicted signal is strengthened, is defined by the parameter smooth_int [minute]. The shorter this interval, the steeper the smoothing effect rises towards future.</li>
<li>Standard deviation of the random prediction error (dimensionless parameter SE). A new random value is superimposed to the future GI values each time after passing a 6-minute interval of prediction. Hence the impact of random error on GIf(t+Δt) is statistically cumulated.</li>
</ul>
<p>GI predictors with two different accuracies have been simulated:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Better prediction accuracy”: smooth_int = 6 minutes, SE = 0.05</li>
<li>"Worse prediction accuracy": smooth_int = 3 minutets, SE = 0.1.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each method, the smoothing quality and the rate of accumulated energy were analyzed by means of LPF orders 1 to 4. Filters of different orders are tuned to generate equivalent smoothing quality, provided that the filters of different orders are excited by the measured, optimally shifted input signal (like in IPLPF case). When adhering this tuning rule, increasing of the LPF order increases its cut-off frequency, while the optimal advance Δt increases only slightly.<br />
The smoothing of PV power during a day with strong solar intermittency was analyzed by the four above-listed smoothing methods:
The results of analysis are graphically displayed. The prediction error (see Figure 2, Figure 6) exhibits the following empiric dependencies along the partial OLAP dimensions:</p>
<h3 id="smoothing-quality-by-prediction-error">Smoothing quality by prediction error</h3>
<h4 id="smoothed-predicted-signal">Smoothed predicted signal</h4>
<ul>
<li>Changing the value of smooth_int affects the power smoothing quality neither by SPLPF nor by PLPF method, while for all parameter values, the SPLPF method provides worse smoothing than the PLPF method (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 7, Figure 8).</li>
<li>Lowering the value of smooth_int dramatically increases the accumulation rate by the PLPF method, which is always much larger than the accumulation rate by SPLPF method (Figure 5, Figure 9). For some parameter values, the PLPF method even exceeds the accumulation rate induced by the LPF method (Figure 9). In the SPLPF method, the accumulation rate increases only slightly and much more slowly than in the PLPF method.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="random-error-in-predicted-values">Random error in predicted values</h4>
<ul>
<li>Increasing of SE parameter does not degrade the smoothing quality by the PLPF method, but it does degrade the smoothing by the SPLPF method (check Figure 7 vs Figure 8), in which the smoothing performance with standard error SE &gt; 0 is always worse than in the PLPF method.</li>
<li>Increasing the value of SE parameter significantly increases the accumulation rate by the PLPF method (Figure 5, Figure 9), which is for all values SE &gt; 0 much higher than by the SPLPF method. For some SE values, the PLPF method even exceeds the LPF method in its accumulation rate. The accumulation rate increases only slightly in the SPLPF method, and less so the higher the filter order.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smoothing-quality-by-lpf-order">Smoothing quality by LPF order</h3>
<p>Filter order is the third OLAP dimension, impact of which was analyzed together with the prediction error. We analyzed the LPF orders 1 to 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filter order does not affect the smoothing quality of PLPF method and for small filter orders, the smoothing quality of PLPF is better than that of SPLPF.</li>
<li>Increasing of the filter order improves the smoothing quality of SPLPF, which becomes technically equivalent with PLPF from the 3th order onwards.</li>
<li>Increasing of the filter order only slightly reduces the accumulation rate by the PLPF method. The accumulation rate by PLPF is always substantially larger than by SPLPF.</li>
<li>Increasing of the filter order appreciably reduces the accumulation rate by the SPLPF method. <strong><em>By increasing the filter order with a relatively small prediction error, SPLPF gradually converges to the accumulation rate induced by the IPLPF method.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>The signal GI(t) is graphically displayed as measured, predicted, and smoothed by the four different smoothing methods. Finally, a per-day time course of the specific accumulated energy GX [Wh/m2] is displayed, corresponding to the smoothing method. Performance of the 3rd-order low-pass filter is shown by the graphs. Two days with strong solar intermittency have been selected for the simulation: a day with medium solar exposure 3.0 kWh/m2, and a day with high solar exposure 5.9 kWh/m2 (measured at the above-specified plane of incidence). Time advance Δt = 30 minutes was applied in order to achieve a desired smoothing effect on both selected days. Accumulation rate by the four different smoothing methods was calculated, based on the measured GI(t) signal. The results are summarized in Table 2 and Table 3: In the column "Δ GX", a difference between the maximum and minimum specific accumulated energy is calculated by the expression (4). In the column "Throughput", a total daily flow of the specific energy through the accumulator is calculated by (5). For a comparison, the daily specific global exposure at the plane of incidence is  displayed too.</p>

<p>With "better GI prediction accuracy", the SPLPF smoothing required 21% - 22% of the BESS energy capacity (Δ GX) used by the LPF method during the selected days, or 24% - 41% of the capacity used by the PLPF method. SPLPF eventually required 1.0 - 1.2 times the energy capacity used by the IPLPF method. The SPLPF smoothing put 58% - 73% of the energy flow through the accumulator relative to the LPF method, or 75% - 83% of the energy throughput by the PLPF method. SPLPF eventually put 1.0 - 1.1 times more energy through BESS than the IPLPF method.</p>
<p>With "worse GI prediction accuracy", the SPLPF smoothing required 24% - 33% of the BESS energy capacity (Δ GX) used by the LPF method during the selected days, or 19% - 28% of the capacity used by the PLPF method. SPLPF eventually required 1.2 - 1.8 times the energy capacity used by the IPLPF method. The SPLPF method put 59% - 77% of the daily energy flow through the accumulator relative to the LPF method, or 63% - 69% of the energy throughput by the PLPF method. SPLPF eventually put 1.0 - 1.1 times more  energy through BESS than the IPLPF method.</p>
<p>Although we haven't analyzed the whole year (simulation of GIf is computationally intensive), the analysis of 4 smoothing methods based on 2 days with high solar intermittency, different solar exposures and various prediction error gave us a real assumption that SPLPF performs much better than PLPF, and that <strong><em>SPLPF performs close to the ideal smoothing IPLPF with the appropriate filter order and if the prediction error is not too high.</em></strong> These empiric results have been also theoretically justified.</p>
