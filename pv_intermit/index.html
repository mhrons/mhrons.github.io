<p><strong>Impact on the grid</strong><br />
Moving clouds cause that the PV power is unstable over time. As the share of photovoltaic (PV) power in the grid grows, its fluctuations pose an increasing risk to the power quality and the grid stability. To mitigate this phenomenon, the grid operator sets the PV generators off-grid (or at least to low-efficiency mode) while the solar intermittency is strong. The losses of intermittent PV energy were e.g. 7% in 2011 in the US state Arizona. This loss-rate is determined by the potential magnitude of fluctuating PV power in the grid, given by the solar intermittency and by the share of PV power in the grid: The larger PV share, the higher relative(!) losses of PV energy due to its intermittency. Extra grid-control costs are raised by the PV intermittency. This overall impact has been projected to the last guaranteed feed-in tariff for new PV installations in Germany: In 2020, a new feed-in tariff was only about 1/3 of the purchase tariff. The state guarantee has been canceled as of 2021, and there is no more doubt that only technical innovations can further augment the PV share in the grid: Smoothing of PV power could eliminate the losses of PV energy and the costs of additional grid control. A smooth time course of renewable power can be easily complemented by other resources (e.g. gas- and water turbines), which is impossible with the rapidly-changing renewable power.  </p>
<h2 id="losless-smoothing-of-pv-power">Losless smoothing of PV power</h2>
<p>Energy balancing between the grid and the battery may smooth the fluctuating intermittent PV power almost loss-free. A tradeoff of the lossless PV smoothing is that it takes up expensive accumulation capacity. There have been several smoothing algorithms published, accumulating less energy than the basic application of a low-pass filter (LPF) does. Actually, these smoothing methods still accumulate too much energy which prevents them from being economically viable.<br />
Our first goal was to analyze the ideal PV smoothing model, accumulating the minimum energy in theory, while exciting LPF by the exact future PV power signal. Based on the solar radiation data measured over 1 year, we have aggregated the accumulated energy by the ideal smoothing. Its corresponding cost has proven that the ideal PV smoothing would be highly affordable at the german purchase and PV feed-in tariffs valid in 2021.<br />
Next, we optimized the smoothing model in order to minimize energy storage even when the predicted PV power signal is biased by error. Based on the measured data, we aggregated its accumulated energy at different prediction errors. With low predatiction error, the optimized smoothing model performs close to the ideal smoothing. It remains affordable, unless the prediction error is too high.</p>
