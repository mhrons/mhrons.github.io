My name is **Milan Hronsk√Ω**  
I am an electrical engineer, focussing on the propagation of stochastic signals through linear systems.   Currently I work on a better integration of renewable energy in the grid.  

A common problem of renewable energy is its [intermittency](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_intermit/).
The share of fossile and nuclear energy in the grid will remain high, unless the time course of renewable power is smooth. My goal is to make the lossless smoothing of renewable power **affordable**.  
I have developed a novel lossless smoothing of renewable power, accumulating a minimum energy. My smoothing method SPLPF is highly effective with energy storage systems providing high relative power, like e.g. flywheel (FESS) or supercapacitor (EDLC).  
I have a pending patent app. No. PCT/SK2022/050014 in the smoothing of renewable power. The European Patent Office has recently issued an International Search Report based on my patent application, confirming its novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability.  
I am currently searching an industrial & funding partner who might benefit from my technology.
