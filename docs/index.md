My name is **Milan Hronsk√Ω**  
I work on  **better integration of renewable energy in the grid**.  
A common problem of renewable energy is its [intermittency](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_intermit/).
The fossile and nuclear energy in the grid will remain high, unless the time course of renewable power is effectively smoothed. Trying to increase the share of renewable energy in the grid by technical means.  

My photovoltaic projects:

- [PV Logger](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/)

- [PV Smoothing](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_smooth/)
