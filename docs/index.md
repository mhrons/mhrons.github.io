&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello! My name is Milan Hronský  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am an electrical engineer researching the propagation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of stochastic signals in linear systems. Currently I work  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; towards better integration of renewable energy in the grid.  

A common problem of the renewable power is its [intermittency](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_intermit/).
The share of fossile and nuclear energy in the grid will remain high, unless the renewable power is stable over time. The first stage of its stabilizing is [smoothing the renewable power](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_smooth/) on a low aggregation level.  
A lossless filter of intermittent power, accumulating a minimum of energy, will be discussed here in theory and practise. Its energy storage system (ESS) has been mimized in terms of its energy capacity, and it can provide [synthetic inertia](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_intermit/#smoothing-synthetic-inertia) to the grid on days with low solar/wind intermittency, as a by-product.  
The novel smoothing method [SPLPF](https://mhrons.github.io/splpf/) is highly effective with low [Wh] capacity ESS providing high relative power [W/Wh] like e.g. flywheel (FESS) or supercapacitor (EDLC). Having a pending patent app. No. PCT/SK2022/050014 in the smoothing of renewable power, I am searching an industrial & funding partner who might benefit from this technology.
