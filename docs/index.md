Hello! My name is **Milan Hronsk√Ω**  
I am an electrical engineer researching the propagation of stochastic signals through linear systems. I am working on a better integration of renewable energy in the grid.  

A common problem of renewable energy is its [intermittency](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_intermit/).
The share of fossile and nuclear energy in the grid will remain high, unless the time course of renewable power is smooth. My goal is to **smooth the renewable power by lossless and affordable means**.  
I have developed a new filter of renewable power, accumulating a minimum of energy. My smoothing method [SPLPF](https://mhrons.github.io/splpf/) operates highly effective with energy storage systems (ESS) providing a high relative power [W/Wh] like e.g. flywheel (FESS) or supercapacitor (EDLC).  
I have a pending patent app. No. PCT/SK2022/050014 in the smoothing of renewable power. The European Patent Office has recently issued an International Search Report confirming its novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability.  
I am currently searching an industrial & funding partner who might benefit from my technology.

My photovoltaic projects:
