# Mittigating the RES impact on grid
This section gives, among others, an ***ordered overview*** of my work:

## Intermittency & null PV intertia
Renewable power should be for free but actually, it is far from being such. Moving clouds and gusty winds cause that the renewable power is unstable over time. Since the share of renewable energy sources (RES) grows in the grid, their random power fluctuations and lack of PV inertia pose an increasing risk to the grid's overload and destabilization, and worsen the power quality. To mitigate this impact, the grid's transmission capacity is being reinforced in order to balance the power on a high aggregation level, and over long distances by large-scale water pumps or gass turbines providing sufficient inertia and a reasonably fast power response. Increasing the share of renewable energy requires ever greater investments in the grid infrastructure, which eventually increase the end-user price of electricity and is aesthetically damaging to the landscape.  
## Power smoothing
A lot of grid investments, transmission losses and landscape could be saved, if the power were balanced on a lower aggregation level, than is currently the case. A substantial portion of the RES balancing can be done by its lossless smoothing (appropriate power balancing between the grid and a storage) on a low aggregation level, or per-RES in case of utitlity-scale RES. The intermittent power of RES can be smoothed by its low-pass filtering which is almost loss-free. But such a [low-pass filter (LPF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter) needs a fast energy storage (ESS) which is large and expensive, unless the LPF is excited by the exact future power singal that has to be filtered. Ultra-short-term predicting (nowcasting) of the renewable power is available, though not enough accurate to shrink the accumulated energy near to its theoretical minimum. Actually, the lossless smoothing of renewable power is not yet affordable on a commercial basis.  
Our ***first objective*** was to analyze the ideal power smoothing model [IPLPF](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_smooth/#ideal-predictive-smoothing-iplpf), exciting the LPF with the exact future PV power signal. In theory, such a future-excited filter eliminates the unnecessary accumulation of energy related with its time lag. Based on the measured solar radiation [GI(t)](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/) over the time span of 1+ year, the ideal PV power smoothing model was numerically simulated. Given the output power ramping limit, the LPF parameters were optimized to minimize the storage capacity, the cost of which determines the price payback of lossless power smoothing. The IPLPF model eventually allows for aggregating a [specific accumulation rate](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_smooth/#specific-accumulation-rate) on a daily basis, thus quantifying the solar intermittency.  
***Next***, a novel [SPLPF](https://mhrons.github.io/splpf/) smoothing method has been designed in order to minimize the accumulated energy by LPF when its future input power signal is distorted by a prediction error, since this error is inevitable in the real-time power smoothing. Given the measured solar data [GI(t)](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/), the accumulation rate of SPLPF smoothing was aggregated by applying a variable prediction error at the LPF input: With the low to medium prediction error, the SPLPF smoothing performs close to the IPLPF model, much better than the LPF excited by the same predicted input signal does. The numeric simulation gives a real presumption that the SPLPF smoothing is affordable with the nowcasted PV power signal.  

## Ramping limit of RES
However low is the energy accumulated by the RES smoothing, its storage is not for free. Smoothing of either local or aggregated renewable power pays-off only with a favourable tariff granted for meeting the prescribed power ramping limits. The goal is to minimize the sum "smoothing costs" plus "costs of other power balancing measures" plus "power losses due to the curtailment regulation of RES" (ideally, to get rid of the RES curtailment). Given the power ramping limit of RES and the measured signal [GI(t)](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/) and its prediction error, the specific accumulation rate and the specific cost of the real smoothing can be aggregated. The minimum cost criterion can be eventually iterated by changing the RES power ramping limit, untill this one is optimized.

## Grid inertia
In standard power plants, turbines and genrators are fixed on a common shaft. Actually, their 3-phase alternators are synchronous reciprocating motor-generators. The frequency of induced AC voltage is given by their angular velocity (RPM), and vice versa. Since many alternators are connected to the grid in parallel, the frequency and phase of all connected units must be synchronized. Their reciprocity and inertia help keeping the grid in balance: Thanks to this, the total generated power is always equal to the total drawned power. In case of a reduction in power draw, the grid accumulates the excess energy by increasing the angular momentum of turbine-generators, and vice versa. Changes in power consumption result in the changes of grid frequency. As a counter-measure, the turbines must accordingly modify their power in order to keep the grid frequency close to constant. The inertia of generators serve as an energy buffer-storage, being irreplaceable part of the grid control system.  
PV inverters are electronically synchronized from AC voltage in the grid. PV inverters provide no inertia because they cannot accumulate energy. They just curtail their PV infeed in case of a power surplus. The more installed PV power, the relatively less inertia in the grid. The less inertia, the deeper and faster frequency changes and the less grid stability. So far, this is the impact of the installed PV power without smoothing.

### Smoothing & synthetic inertia
However, the inverter's oscillation must not be fully subordinated to the grid. As already mentioned, ESS is a prerequisite of the lossless power smoothing. Once installed, the storage is not always fully occupied by the smoothing - this depends on the solar intermittency. BESS and its inverter can ***eventually*** provide both smoothing and inertia: The spare ESS capacity can emulate a "synthetic inertia", if either a) two-way inverter between BESS and grid oscillates analogue like the turbine shaft rotates, or b) flywheel & alternator on a common shaft serve as FESS. Rate of the synthetic angular inertia can be dynamically adjusted according to the momentary spare ESS capacity (depends on the momentary solar intermittency). Thus, the installed ESS is fully utilized even on days with low solar intermittency - including lots of days with weak solar radiation.
