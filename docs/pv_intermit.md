# Intermittency of renewable power
## Impact on the grid 
Moving clouds and gusty winds make the renewable power unstable over time. As the share of renewable energy sources (RES) grows in the grid, their random power fluctuations pose an increasing risk to the grid's stability and the power quality. To mitigate this, the grid's transmission capacity is being overrated in order to smooth the random time course of renewable power on a high aggregation level over long distances by water pumps or gass turbines. Increasing the share of renewable energy requires ever greater investment in building the grid infrastructure, which increases the price of electricity and is aesthetically damaging to the landscape.  
## Smoothing of renewable power
Extra grid investments, transmission losses and landscape could be saved by smoothing the intermittent power localy, or on its low aggregation level. Balancing of energy between the grid and a storage (ESS) may smooth the intermittent power almost loss-free by applying a low-pass power filter (LPF). A disadvantage of the local power smoothing is that it takes up a fast, high-capacity ESS which is expensive. There have been advanced smoothing algorithms published, accumulating less energy than a basic application of LPF does. Actually, the known filtering methods still accumulate too much energy, preventing the local application of ESS from the affordable power smoothing.  
Our first objective was to analyze the ideal power smoothing model [IPLPF](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_smooth/#ideal-predictive-smoothing-iplpf), exciting a LPF with the exact future PV power signal, in theory eliminating the unnecessary accumulation of energy caused by the LPF's time lag, thus accumulating a minimum of energy. Based on the measured solar radiation [GI(t)](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/) over a time span of 1+ year, the ideal power smoothing model was numerically simulated. The aggregated [specific accumulation rate](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_smooth/#specific-accumulation-rate) provides a reference quantifier of solar intermittency on one side, while the corresponding specific accumulation cost indicates a potential affordability of the ideal smoothing of PV power.  
Next, a novel [SPLPF](https://mhrons.github.io/splpf/) smoothing method has been theoretically optimized in order to minimize the accumulated energy by LPF even when its input future power signal is distorted by a prediction error, since this error increases the accumulated energy either way. Given the measured solar data [GI(t)](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/), the energy accumulated by SPLPF smoothing was aggregated while applying a variable prediction error at the LPF input: With low to medium prediction error, the SPLPF smoothing performs close to the IPLPF model and much better than the LPF excited with the same predicted input signal does. The numeric simulation has confirmed that the SPLPF smoothing is affordable with the predicted PV power signal.  

## RES power ramping limit
However low is the energy accumulated by the smoothing of renewable power, its storage is not for free. Any local or aggregated smoothing of renewable power would pay-off only with a favourable tarif granted for meeting the given power ramping limits. The goal is to keep the sum "power smoothing costs" plus "other grid balancing measures" plus "renewable power losses due to its curtailment regulation" at minimum and if possible, to get rid of the power curtailment. Given the RES power ramping limit and the measured signal [GI(t)](https://mhrons.github.io/pv_log/) and its prediction error, the specific accumulation rate and smoothing cost can be aggregated. The minimum criterion can be eventually iterated by varrying the ramping limit unless this is optimized.
