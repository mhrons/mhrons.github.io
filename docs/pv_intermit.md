# Photovoltaic intermittency
**Impact on the grid**  
Moving clouds cause the photovoltaic power to be unstable over time. As the share of PV power grows in the grid, its fluctuations pose an increasing risk to the power quality and grid stability. To mitigate this risk, the grid operator sets PV generators off-grid (or at least to a low-efficiency mode) while the solar intermittency is strong. Such losses of PV energy were e.g. 7% in 2011 in the US state Arizona. The loss-rate is determined by the solar intermittency and by the installed PV power in the grid: The larger PV share, the higher relative(!) losses of PV energy due to its intermittency. Extra grid-control costs are raised by the PV intermittency. This overall impact has been projected to the last guaranteed feed-in tariff for new PV installations in Germany: In 2020, a new feed-in tariff was only about 1/3 of the purchase tariff. The state guarantee has been canceled as of 2021, and there is no more doubt that only technical innovations can further augment the PV share in the grid: Smoothing of PV power could eliminate the losses of PV energy and the costs of additional grid control. A smooth time course of renewable power can be easily complemented by other resources (e.g. gas- and water turbines), which is impossible with the rapidly-changing renewable power.  

## Losless smoothing of PV power
Energy balancing between the grid and a battery may smooth the fluctuating intermittent PV power almost loss-free. The disadvantage of lossless PV smoothing is that it takes up expensive storage capacity. There have been several smoothing algorithms published, accumulating less energy than the basic application of a low-pass power filter (LPF) does. Actually, these smoothing methods still accumulate too much energy which prevents them from being economically viable.  
Our first goal was to analyze an ideal PV smoothing model, accumulating minimum energy in theory, while exciting LPF by the exact future PV power signal. Based on the solar radiation data measured over 1 year, we numerically simulated the operation of the ideal smoothing model. We have aggregated its accumulated energy and its corresponding cost. Such an accumulation rate may serve as a reference quantifier of solar intermittency, while the accumulation cost indicates the potential affordability of PV smoothing under ideal conditions. The ideal smoothing has proven to be highly affordable at the German purchase and PV feed-in tariffs as of 2021.  
Next, we optimized the smoothing model in order to minimize the energy storage even when the predicted PV power signal is biased by error (definitely increasing the accumulation rate). Based on the measured solar data, we aggregated the accumulated energy by the optimized model with a variable prediction error. With low to medium prediction error, the optimized model performs close to the ideal smoothing, much better than the LPF with the same prediction error does. The optimized smothing model remains affordable with a real-predicted PV power.
