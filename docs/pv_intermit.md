# Photovoltaic intermittency
**Impact on the grid**  
Moving clouds cause that the photovoltaic power is unstable over time. As the share of PV power grows in the grid, its fluctuations pose an increasing risk to the power quality and grid stability. To mitigate this risk, the grid operator sets PV generators off-grid (or at least to a low-efficiency mode) while the solar intermittency is strong. Such losses of PV energy were e.g. 7% in 2011 in the US state Arizona. The loss-rate is determined by the solar intermittency and by the installed PV power in the grid: The larger PV share, the higher relative(!) losses of PV energy due to its intermittency. Extra grid-control costs exist due to the PV intermittency. This overall impact has been projected to the last guaranteed feed-in tariff for new PV installations in Germany: In 2020, the feed-in tariff for a newly installed small PV plant was only about 1/3 of the purchase tariff. The state guarantee has been canceled as of 2021, and there is no more doubt that only technical innovations can further augment the PV share in the grid: Smoothing of PV power could eliminate the losses of PV energy and the costs of additional grid control. A smooth time course of renewable power can be easily complemented by other resources (e.g. gas- and water turbines), which is impossible with the rapidly-changing renewable power.  

## Losless smoothing of PV power
Balancing of energy between the grid and a storage (ESS) may smooth the intermittent renewable power almost loss-free. A disadvantage of the lossless power smoothing is that it takes up expensive storage capacity. There have been advanced smoothing algorithms published, accumulating less energy than the basic application of a low-pass power filter (LPF) does. Actually, the known smoothing methods still accumulate too much energy, preventing them from being commercially successful.  
Our first goal was to analyze an ideal PV smoothing model (IPLPF), accumulating a minimum of energy in theory by exciting LPF with an exact future PV power signal. Based on the measured solar radiation data over a time span of 1 year, the ideal smoothing model was numerically simulated. Its accumulated energy and corresponding costs have been aggregated. Given a reference LPF, the specific accumulation rate of IPLPF has been aggregated which serves as a reference quantifier of the solar intermittency, while the corresponding specific accumulation cost indicates a potential affordability of PV smoothing. The ideal smoothing has proven to be highly affordable with the German purchase and PV feed-in tariffs as of 2021.  
Next, the smoothing model has been theoretically optimied (patent pending method SPLPF) in order to minimize the necessary storage when the predicted PV power signal is biased with error (prediction error increases the accumulation rate). Given the measured solar data, the accumulated energy of the SPLPF model was aggregated, applying a variable prediction error. With low to medium prediction error, the optimized model performs close to the ideal smoothing, much better than the LPF excited by the same predicted signal does. The numeric simulation has justified our theoretical presumption that the optimized smoothing model SPLPF is affordable with a real-predicted PV power signal.
