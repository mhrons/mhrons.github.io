# Photovoltaic intermittency
**Impact on the grid**  
Moving clouds cause that the photovoltaic power is unstable over time. As the share of PV power grows in the grid, its fluctuations pose an increasing risk to the grid's power quality and stability. To mitigate this, the grid operator sets PV generators off-grid (or at least to a low-efficiency mode) while the solar intermittency is high. Such losses of PV energy were e.g. 7% in 2011 in the US state Arizona. This loss-rate is determined by the solar intermittency and by the installed PV power in the grid: The larger PV share, the higher relative(!) losses of PV energy due to its intermittency. Extra grid-control costs and energy losses could be eliminated by a lossless smoothing of the power from renewable energy sources (RES). Once smoothed, the time course of renewable power can be easily complemented by other resources (e.g. gas- and water turbines), which is impossible with the rapidly-changing renewable power.  
The overall impact of PV intermittency has been projected to the last guaranteed feed-in tariff for new PV installations in Germany: In 2020, the feed-in tariff for a newly installed small PV plant was only about 1/3 of the electricity purchase tariff. The state guarantee has been canceled as of 2021, and there is no more doubt that only technical innovations may keep the PV feed-in tariff profitable and so augment the PV share in the grid. As the share of renewable energy in the grid grows, there will come a time when its lossless smoothing will be a necessity.  
## Lossless smoothing of PV power
Balancing of energy between the grid and a storage (ESS) may smooth the intermittent renewable power almost loss-free. A disadvantage of the lossless power smoothing is that it takes up an expensive storage capacity. There have been advanced smoothing algorithms published, accumulating less energy than the basic application of a low-pass power filter (LPF) does. Actually, the known filtering methods still accumulate too much energy, preventing the lossless smoothing from being commercially applied.  
Our first goal was to analyze an ideal PV smoothing model (IPLPF), exciting LPF by the exact future PV power signal, thus eliminating the accumulation of energy due to the LPF's time lag, in theory accumulating a minimum of energy. Based on the measured solar radiation data over a time span of 1 year, the ideal smoothing model was ex-post numerically simulated. The aggregated specific accumulation rate serves as a reference quantifier of the solar intermittency, while the corresponding specific accumulation cost indicates a potential affordability of PV smoothing. The ideal smoothing has proven to be highly affordable with the German electricity purchase tariffs and PV feed-in tariffs as of 2021.  
Next, a novel SPLPF smoothing method (patent pending) was theoretically optimized in order to minimize the accumulated energy by the filter when the future PV power signal is distorted by the prediction error, since this error increases the energy accumulation by smoothing. Given the measured solar data, the energy accumulated by SPLPF was aggregated with a variable prediction error. With low to medium prediction error, the optimized model performs close to the ideal smoothing, much better than the LPF excited with the same predicted signal does. The numeric simulation has confirmed our theoretical presumption that the optimized smoothing model SPLPF is affordable with the predicted PV power signal.  

## Ramping limit of PV power
However low is the energy accumulated by the smoothing of renewable power, its storage is not for free and the smoothing pays-off only with a favourable "smooth feed-in tariff" granted to those PV prosumers who meet the given ramping limits. The goal is to keep the sum "grid control costs" plus "PV power losses due to its curtailment regulation" plus "PV smoothing costs" at minimum and if possible, to get rid of the PV power curtailment. Given the PV ramping limit and the measured signal GI(t) and its prediction error, the accumulation rate hence the smoothing cost can be aggregated. The minimum criterion can be eventually iterated, unless the PV ramping limit is optimized.
